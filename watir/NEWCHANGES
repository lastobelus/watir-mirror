== Version 1.6.1

* Fixed install errors reported by Marek J and Tony.

== Version 1.6.0

This release merges the Watir and FireWatir projects. It contains many compatibility fixes,
as well as a new browser-independent interface your tests can use to allow you
to execute them against either browser (or Safari or Celerity). This release
also contains many other fixes.

Watir and FireWatir are still distributed as separate gems. Installing the 
Watir gem will automatically install FireWatir. Both gems now use common code
contained in the "commonwatir" gem.

This release is fully backwards compatible with previous versions of Watir and
FireWatir. Your existing scripts should continue to run without change.

=== Installation

To install both Watir and FireWatir:

  gem update --system
  gem install watir
  
To only install FireWatir (e.g. on Mac or Linux)

  gem update --system
  gem install firewatir
  
To enable Firefox to work with Watir, you will also need to install the JSSH plugin. See this
page for details.

=== New Features

Replace references to Watir::IE.new to Watir::Browser.new to allow you to
specify which browser to run your tests against at run time. Details:

=== Compatibility Fixes


=== IE Fixes
* Fix for:  form field named "submit" causes "submit" method to not work. 
  Closes #223.
* Calling ie.radio().set now scrolls to the page to the control, as with other
  controls. Thanks to Jonathan Kohl for the fix. Closes #172.
* Fixed ie.speed, which was returning ":fast" when speed was actually ":zippy".

=== Unit Test Improvements
* New rake targets for Watir: test and cruise, each of which runs the core tests.
* Numerous fixes and cleanup to the unit test suite.
* The unit tests use the new Browser.new interface and therefore can be run
  against either implementation (Watir::IE or FireWatir::Firefox or others for
  that matter). See this page for details.
