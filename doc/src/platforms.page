Watir 1.6 provides a single browser interface that can be configured at run 
time to execute against any supported browser.

h2. Internet Explorer 

The Windows version of Watir includes support for Internet Explorer. 
It works with IE 5.5, 6 and 7 and Windows 2000, XP, 2003 Server and Vista.

Watir has supported IE since 2003.

h2. Firefox

FireWatir is the name of the Watir library that supports Firefox. It is 
automatically installed when you install Watir 1.6 on Windows. It can also
be installed separately on Windows, Mac or Linux.

It supports FireFox 2 and FireFox 3.

The FireWatir project was merged into the Watir project Summer 2008. Both 
libraries are now maintained by the same team and community.

h2. Safari

"SafariWatir":http://safariwatir.rubyforge.org/ is the name of the Watir 
library that supports Safari on OS X. 

SafariWatir is an active project with good relations with the Watir community.

h2. Other Browsers

Selenium is a popular open-source testing tool that supports most browsers,
including Opera, Camino and Konqueror. The Selenium-RC library includes Ruby 
support. We have demonstrated "a Watir interface that 
uses Selenium":http://awta.wikispaces.com/Common+Driver+for+Selenium+and+Watir
to drive a browser, and expect to eventually grow this into a full-blown port.

Experimental ports of Watir have been made for Opera and WebKit, although they
have not been released yet.

h2. Running without a Browser

"Celerity":http://celerity.rubyforge.org is a Watir library that allows tests to run without using a browser.
It is fast.
