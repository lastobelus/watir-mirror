h2. Automated testing that doesn't hurt

Watir is an open-source library for automating web browsers. 
It allows you to write tests that are easy to read and maintain. 
It is simple and flexible.

Watir drives browsers the same way people do. 
It clicks links, fills in forms, presses buttons. 
Watir also checks results, such as whether expected text appears on the page.

Watir is a family of Ruby libraries. They support Internet Explorer on
Windows, Firefox on Windows, Mac and Linux, and Safari on Mac.

Like other programming languages, Ruby gives you the power to 
connect to databases, read data files and spreadsheets, export XML, and 
structure your code as reusable libraries. 
Unlike other programing languages, Ruby is concise and often a joy to read.

Watir stands for "Web Application Testing in Ruby". 
It is pronounced _water._

h2. Why Watir?

* It's a free "Open Source":http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php tool. There are no costs to use the tool.
* There's a very active and growing "community":community.html behind it.
* It uses "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org, a full-featured modern scripting language, 
  rather than a "proprietary vendorscript":http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?ObjectId=2326&ObjectType=COL&Function=edetail.
* It is powerful and easy to use. 
* Don't just take our word for it, "read what our users are saying.":http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Testimonials
