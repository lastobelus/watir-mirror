Watir is a family of drivers for different browsers running on several 
operating systems. This page provides an overview of how to install the leading
drivers on several operating systems.

h2. Install Ruby

h3. Windows

Install Ruby using the "one-click installer":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167 
for Windows. We recommend using the latest version
of Ruby 1.8.6 with Watir 1.6. 
"More details.":http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Install+Ruby

With Watir 1.5 users had who used its support for the IE showModalDialog had
to use Ruby 1.8.2. With Watir 1.6, these users should now be using Ruby 1.8.6
just like everybody else.

h3. Mac and Linux

Ruby is probably already installed on your machine. You can verify which version
of Ruby is install by typing this command in a terminal window:

Watir drivers are packaged as _gems_, Ruby libraries that can be installed
over the internet.
