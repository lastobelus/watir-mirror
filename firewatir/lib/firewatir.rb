   This is FireWatir, Web Application Testing In Ruby using Firefox browser
   The home page for this project is http://code.google.com/p/firewatir

   Typical usage:
    # include the controller
    require "firewatir"

    # go to the page you want to test
    ff = FireWatir::Firefox.start("http://myserver/mypage")

    # enter "Angrez" into an input field named "username"
    ff.text_field(:name, "username").set("Angrez")

    # enter "Ruby Co" into input field with id "company_ID"
    ff.text_field(:id, "company_ID").set("Ruby Co")

    # click on a link that has "green" somewhere in the text that is displayed
    # to the user, using a regular expression
    ff.link(:text, /green/)

    # click button that has a caption of "Cancel"
    ff.button(:value, "Cancel").click

   FireWatir allows your script to read and interact with HTML objects--HTML tags
   and their attributes and contents.  Types of objects that FireWatir can identify
   include:

   Type         Description
   ===========  ===============================================================
   button       <input> tags, with the type="button" attribute
   check_box    <input> tags, with the type="checkbox" attribute
   div          <div> tags
   form
   frame
   hidden       hidden <input> tags
   image        <img> tags
   label
   link         <a> (anchor) tags
   p            <p> (paragraph) tags
   radio        radio buttons; <input> tags, with the type="radio" attribute
   select_list  <select> tags, known informally as drop-down boxes
   span         <span> tags
   table        <table> tags
   text_field   <input> tags with the type="text" attribute (a single-line
                text field), the type="text_area" attribute (a multi-line
                text field), and the type="password" attribute (a
                single-line field in which the input is replaced with asterisks)

   In general, there are several ways to identify a specific object.  FireWatir's
   syntax is in the form (how, what), where "how" is a means of identifying
   the object, and "what" is the specific string or regular expression
   that FireWatir will seek, as shown in the examples above.  Available "how"
   options depend upon the type of object, but here are a few examples:

   How           Description
   ============  ===============================================================
   :id           Used to find an object that has an "id=" attribute. Since each
                 id should be unique, according to the XHTML specification,
                 this is recommended as the most reliable method to find an
                 object.
   :name         Used to find an object that has a "name=" attribute.  This is
                 useful for older versions of HTML, but "name" is deprecated
                 in XHTML.
   :value        Used to find a text field with a given default value, or a
                 button with a given caption
   :index        Used to find the nth object of the specified type on a page.
                 For example, button(:index, 2) finds the second button.
                 Current versions of FireWatir use 1-based indexing, but future
                 versions will use 0-based indexing.
   :xpath	     The xpath expression for identifying the element.
   
   Note that the XHTML specification requires that tags and their attributes be
   in lower case.  FireWatir doesn't enforce this; FireWatir will find tags and
   attributes whether they're in upper, lower, or mixed case.  This is either
   a bug or a feature.

   FireWatir uses JSSh for interacting with the browser.  For further information on
